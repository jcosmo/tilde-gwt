= dbt

The dbt plugin is designed to simplify the creation, migration and deletion of databases.
Each database contains a number of _modules_ that are loaded and migrated in a
specific order. Each _module_ is stored in a directory with the same name as the _module_
key used when defining the database.

== Database Creation

When a _module_ is loaded the plugin will attempt to load SQL scripts from a number of
sub-directories of the _module_ dir. The SQL scripts in each directory are sorted
alpha-numerically before being executed. The order in which directories are processed is
configurable by DbTasks::Configure.sql_dirs setting but defaults to:

* .
* types
* views
* functions
* stored-procedures
* triggers
* misc

After loading the SQL scripts the plugin will attempt to load fixture data from the 'fixtures'
sub-directory of the _module_ dir. The fixture data must be in a YAML formated file that matches
the table named with .yml appended. The order that the fixture data is loaded in is fixed and
described in the "Table Ordering" section below.
